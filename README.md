# rapha.uy
In this repository, you will find the source code for my personal website https://rapha.uy developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
On my website, you can learn a little more about me, my skills, and my professional experience. Additionally, you can also find information about my projects and links to my social media and development platform profiles.

The page has been designed with a modern and minimalist style, using Bootstrap to ensure compatibility with different devices and browsers. Additionally, I have used CSS to customize some elements and give the page a unique touch.

Feel free to explore my repository and use my code for your own projects.
